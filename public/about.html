	Hello everyone! My self Bhavesh Baraiya. Currently I am pursuing Btech ICT in
	DAIICT Gandhinagar. I had took admission through ACPC which includes grades of
	12th and Gujcet exam.
</p>

<p>
	At starting I don't have much knowledge and skills to handle people because I
	am come from a small village. Or may be I haven't tried to learn that! Slowly
	things are getting into the path and Also I have started this amazing course
	on Web Development.
</p>

<p>
	I had created two small projects which you can see on my portfolio website.
	Though it is only created using HTML it feels really good to have it here.
	Step by step this Web development journey is going on and I am really enjoying
	it.
